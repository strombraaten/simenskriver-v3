# Example Writing

Writings are the longer and more coherent pieces: guides, reflections, arguments. These are intended to be complete, even if they're still forming.

## Introduction

Start your writing here.

## Main Content

Add your main content sections as needed.

### Subsection

Use callouts for important information:

> [!tip] Pro Tip
> This is a helpful tip!

Link to other posts using wikilinks: [[example-stash]]

Use highlights for ==important text==.
